Backend: Building the Flask API
We'll create a Flask API to handle trip bookings, pricing, user data, and accommodation.

Prompt for Backend Setup
"Set up a Flask backend with endpoints for:

Trip booking (/book_trip)
Fetching available schedules (/schedules)
Pricing options (/pricing)
User profiles (/user_dashboard)
Accommodation recommendations (/accommodations)
Use Flask‚Äôs Flask-RESTful for API routes and integrate a simple database (SQLite or Firebase) for storing user bookings."**
üëâ Files in Replit:

main.py (Flask app)
routes/booking.py (Trip booking logic)
routes/pricing.py (Pricing & packages)
routes/user.py (User management)
routes/accommodations.py (Space hotels)
database.py (SQLite/Firebase setup)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend: React-based UI
We'll use React.js to build a visually appealing space travel booking interface.

Prompt for Frontend Setup
"Set up a React.js frontend with pages for:

Home (/) ‚Äì Welcome page
Trip Booking (/book) ‚Äì User selects flights & seats
Pricing (/pricing) ‚Äì Shows available travel classes
Dashboard (/dashboard) ‚Äì Displays user's booked trips and countdown timers
Accommodation (/accommodations) ‚Äì Shows space hotels
Use React Router for navigation and Axios to fetch data from the Flask backend."**

src/App.js (Main React app)
src/components/BookingForm.js
src/components/Pricing.js
src/components/Dashboard.js
src/components/Accommodation.js
src/api.js (Handles API requests)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Database: Storing User Data & Bookings
We'll use SQLite (or Firebase) for managing trips, users, and accommodation.

Prompt for Database Setup
"Set up an SQLite database with tables for:

Users (id, name, email, booked_trips, preferences)
Trips (id, departure_date, space_station, seat_class, price)
Accommodations (id, name, type, price, description)"
4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Feature: Personalized Space Travel Tips
We'll integrate an AI system (OpenAI or Hugging Face) to suggest the best space travel experience.

Prompt for AI Integration
"Use OpenAI's GPT API to generate space travel tips based on user preferences and past bookings. Implement an endpoint /ai_tips in Flask that takes user history and returns travel recommendations."
